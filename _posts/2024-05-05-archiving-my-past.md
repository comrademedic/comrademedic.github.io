Hello everyone, its been a while.

Recently ive recieved an email from mediafire aka. the only host that still holds my old repacks.

Most of my repacks (that that still are up) will be deleted by 11th of may from mediafire.

As such ive decided with the help of [Buzzheavier][buzz] i will be doing my best to reupload what is left.

I no longer have the original repacks so i will have to download them from what i can. Im not promising to archive all.
I can garantee i will not archive my larger repacks above 5gb. Why? because it would simply take too long. A side note i have disabled comments on this site.
Simpley no longer see a point in them. With this update im removing the broken comments embed as well.

Once my archiving is done i will make a new post that will replace upcoming games one.

Also while im here i will probably never make repacks again as i as of now have no intentions to do such.

Thanks for Reading
