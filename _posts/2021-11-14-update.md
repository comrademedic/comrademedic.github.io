Hello Averyone. Just a small update on how i will make repacks. It will

* When: When They are done, and i will not give my self time limit, if i dont want to repack i will not. Easy
I will not set dates to release schedule i will only put repack there if i know when im gonna complete it.

* Size: There Was a little break between Postal 2 Repack and Happy Game Why? Easy, 1-3 repacks with too bad size.
I made choice that i will release even those bad repack Why? im proud of them, im proud of my PC that it did it.

* What Games: I will repack whatever there is. Games i will play, games i played, games i will never play.

* And Final Point: Just to make it public - "I will stop repacking when ever i feel like it" Thanks for understanding.
