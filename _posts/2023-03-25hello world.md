Hello World! Im Alive! I took a long break and I think I'm ready to return. I will not go over the boring
boring stuff as that is probably not why you are here. What will/has change/d: 
1) New installer! Yay, from now on I will be using a new installer that is a modified version of ASIS by 
KaktoR over on the FileForums.

2) No Google Drive Mirrors. From now on I will not be uploading to Google Drive. Why? Because there is no longer
a way for me to get access to shared drives I used to have a more than 15 GB limit on Google Drive. Instead
I will look for a new File Hoster where I can get more space. There is 1 repack I have finished but I will
not be able to release it for now because of this situation thanks for understanding

3) I will try to upload frequently but there will not be any schedule. Scheduling a repack or saying I will
do X of repacks this week just puts pressure on myself and I don't want this. Keep in mind this is just a 
Hobby for me.

If you have any questions ask in the comments and I will try to answer.

Thanks for Reading
