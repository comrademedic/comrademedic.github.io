(Originaly made 25.03.2023)

Hello World! Im Alive! I took a long break and I think I'm ready to return. I will not go over the boring
boring stuff as that is probably not why you are here. What will/has change/d: 
1) New installer! Yay, from now on I will be using a new installer that is a modified version of ASIS by 
KaktoR over on the FileForums.

2) No Google Drive Mirrors. From now on I will not be uploading to Google Drive. Why? Because there is no longer
a way for me to get access to shared drives I used to have a more than 15 GB limit on Google Drive. Instead
I will look for a new File Hoster where I can get more space. There is 1 repack I have finished but I will
not be able to release it for now because of this situation thanks for understanding

Edit: As of 27.03 the situation has changed a little bit. I had found couple of user firendly file hosters that have around
the size limit i can work with. So what does that mean? The file hosters ive been using until now will no longer be used
(Mega.nz, OneDrive, Google Drive, MediaFire) with the chance of an exception being OneDrive im currently looking
into a way to get a 1 Terabity disk there so i might use that in the future. I will maybe upload the repack even Today. We will see.

3) I will try to upload frequently but there will not be any schedule. Scheduling a repack or saying I will
do X of repacks this week just puts pressure on myself and I don't want this. Keep in mind this is just a 
Hobby for me.

If you have any questions ask in the comments and I will try to answer.

Thanks for Reading
